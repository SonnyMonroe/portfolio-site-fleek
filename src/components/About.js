            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
            Aspiring Blockchain Developer with a solid understanding of web3 topics such as cryptocurrency, DAO Governance, and DeFi Protocols. My experience stems from participating in yield farms across decentralized applications. I acquired a sound understanding of many dissimilar blockchain ecosystems, their communities, tokenomics, governance, and consensus mechanisms. 

            I am currently enrolled in Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science CS50 program so I can discover the realm of Computer Science and Web Development. 

            Im deeply committed to the principles of decentralization and privacy. I believe that these principles are essential for creating a more open, transparent, and secure world, and I am excited to contribute my skills and expertise to projects that align with these values.
