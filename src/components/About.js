            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
            Aspiring Blockchain Developer with a solid understanding of web3 topics such as cryptocurrency, DAO Governance, and DeFi Protocols. My experience stems from participating in yield farms across decentralized applications. I acquired a sound understanding of many dissimilar blockchain ecosystems, their communities, tokenomics, governance, and consensus mechanisms. 

            I am currently enrolled in Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science CS50 program so I can discover the realm of Computer Science and Web Development. 

            Ultimately, I wish to use my newfound knowledge and experience to contribute to the decentralized economy by developing Decentralized Blockchain applications on the Ethereum Virtual Machine or Cosmos's SDK.
